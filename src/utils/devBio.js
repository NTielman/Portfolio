    description: `Hello! I'm Nneka, a full-stack developer currently chilling on the corner of logic and creativity. I'm based in The Hague and enjoy building engaging things with code. I develop websites, web apps, and mobile apps with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I'm especially passionate about effects & animations, intuitive UI, and creating dynamic user experiences. 

    When I'm not coding, you can find me: reading books on psychology and human behavior, showing love to my plants, drawing cartoons, watching film theories on YouTube, or plotting to take over the world with an army of robots.
    
    Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:`,
